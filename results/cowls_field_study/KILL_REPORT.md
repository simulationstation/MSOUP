## Section C: Null Adequacy Tests

For each of 34 lenses, we generated 20 synthetic r(θ) profiles under the null hypothesis and computed Global Z_corr.

| Null Method | N Simulations | Mean Synth Z | Std Synth Z | p(synth ≥ obs) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Resample | 20 | -0.14 | 1.07 | 0.00 |
| Shift | 20 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |

**Null Warning: NO - nulls are well-calibrated**

The observed Global Z_corr = 3.66 was never exceeded in 20 synthetic realizations (p < 0.05), confirming the null machinery is not generating false positives.

## Section D: Artifact Proxy Correlations

| Proxy | Spearman ρ | p-value | N |
|-------|------------|---------|---|
| residual_rms | 0.441 | 0.0090 | 34 |
| coverage | -0.108 | 0.5427 | 34 |
| texture | -0.029 | 0.8696 | 34 |
| psf_fwhm | 0.199 | 0.2593 | 34 |

**Strongest proxy: residual_rms (ρ = 0.441)**

## Section E: Frequency Structure

- Low-m (m≤3) dominance correlation with Z_corr: ρ = 1.000 *(Note: based on sparse valid samples)*
- Mean low-m ratio: 0.279 (fraction of power in m=1,2,3 modes)
- Lenses with high Z_corr (>0.9) but negative Z_pow: 13/34 (38%)

**Interpretation**: The correlation signal is dominated by low-frequency angular modes, not high-frequency localized structure. This pattern is more consistent with macro-model mismatch than subhalo perturbations.

## Section F: Band Consistency

- Multi-band lenses available: 34 (all have F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W)
- Lenses tested for cross-band consistency: 5
- Sign consistency across all 4 bands: 3/5 = 60%

**Interpretation**: 40% of tested lenses show inconsistent Z_corr signs across bands. If the signal were purely gravitational (achromatic), we'd expect ~100% consistency. The 60% rate suggests a mix of real structure and wavelength-dependent systematics.

---

## Top 5 Mundane Explanations (Ranked by Evidence)

1. **Low-mode (m≤3) macro-model mismatch** (evidence score: 0.8)
   - High Z_corr but Z_pow~0 suggests large-scale smooth residuals, not localized structure

2. **Model quality variation** (evidence score: 0.5)
   - Z_corr correlates with residual RMS, suggesting worse models produce higher Z

3. **Selection effects** (evidence score: 0.3)
   - Arc selection may preferentially select regions with correlated residuals

---

## What Would Still Make It Pockets?

For the signal to be attributed to dark substructure perturbations, we would need:

1. **Mass-scale consistency**: Z_corr should correlate with predicted subhalo abundance for each lens
2. **Spectral signature**: Power should peak at specific angular scales corresponding to subhalo masses
3. **Band independence**: Same Z_corr in all bands (wavelength-independent)
4. **Model improvement test**: Z_corr should decrease when using higher-fidelity lens models
5. **Mock injection recovery**: Injected subhalos should produce similar Z_corr patterns
